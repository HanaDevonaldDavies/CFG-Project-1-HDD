## About Me
Hello! My name is Hana Devonald-Davies, I'm an undergraduate Biomedical Science Student! I developed an interest in coding and tech after meeting a few engineers and computer science students in first year halls. During the COVID-19 Lockdowns they taught me the coding basics and encouraged me to further develop my skills using online sources.

## Project (Current)
### Project 1: Hello World
Project where I created a simple Python script to print \`Hello, World!\`.

## Projects (Previous)
### CFG Python Kickstarter
I recently completed CFG's Introduction to Python course, which provided me with a solid foundation in Python programming and equipped me with essential skills for further development in the field.
### CFG CSS
I have successfully completed CFG's Introduction to CSS course, gaining a solid foundation in styling web pages and enhancing their visual appeal.
### CFG HTML
After completing CFG's introduction to HTML course, I gained a solid understanding of the fundamentals of HTML and feel confident in my ability to create well-structured web pages.

## GitHub Uses (General)
1. Keep track of changes
2. Work with peers and instructors
3. Present work

## How I hope to use GitHub in this project
1. By utilising Git and Github for this assignment, I hope to demonstrate and practice my capabilities with version control. As this assigment acts as a base for me to maintain a history of changes made to my work, allowing me to track my progress and edit previous versions if needed
2. I have used pull requests to propose changes to my repository. This includes adding new features, and making general improvements to the project. By opening pull requests I invite feedback from my instructors, who are able to review my edits, and provide comments and potential improvements.
3. Through the creation of this README.md file, I have provided the basic information about this project, included background on myself, my previous projects, and the purpose of this repository.
4. Using markdown syntax in my README.md file has allowed me to format my text in various ways, including creating headers, lists, and code blocks.
5. Through the assignment, I have used a variety of Git commands to manage my repository, including 'git add', 'git commit', 'git push', 'git merge'. By carrying out these commands, I hope to have demonstrated my proficiency.
6. My ability to create various files through Git Bash, e.g. '.py', '.txt', and '.md'
